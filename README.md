# dotfiles-deploy

## What this script does
This script deploys my special [dotfiles](https://github.com/0xBooper/dotfiles)
It also installs all the things needed

## A few warnings
This script ***WILL*** overwrite your existing dotfiles.

## Things needed 
This script needs a (ideally fresh) install of Arch Linux.
The user should have superuser permissions.

## What about Debian?
This script currently won't work on Debian and Debian based distros.
However, Debian (and Debian based distros) are planned to be supported.

## Actually using it
First, grab the script. Make sure your internet works, and run:
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xBooper/dotfiles-deploy/main/deploydotfiles.sh`

Second, give it permissions. Run:
`chmod +x dotfilesdeploy.sh`

Third, run it. Run the command:
`./dotfilesdeploy.sh`

After the script has finished, your system now has my dotfiles!

(You can now get rid of the script)
